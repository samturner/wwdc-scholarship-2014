# WWDC 2014 Student Scholarship

My submission for the 2014 WWDC Student Scholarship. I was awarded the scholarship with this app.

I've used a few cool things such as:

* **SpriteKit** for rendering the particles in the background on some of the views.
* **MapKit** for showing locations.
* The [**DACircularProgressView**](https://github.com/danielamitay/DACircularProgress) control for showing the progress when cycling through the content on my "What's next" view.
* I've used [**Font Awesome**](http://fontawesome.io) throughout the app where I wanted to show some icons. This works by using a custom NSString category.
* I've used the [**SKBounceAnimation**](https://github.com/khanlou/SKBounceAnimation) framework to do the animations throughout the app.
