# Dollarlog

Dollarlog as an iPhone app that I've recently been developing in my spare time. I wanted to build something that people love and push my skills and develop a more in depth understanding of iOS as a platform.

Dollarlog is a personal finance application, it lets users track and analyse their spending habits. I wanted to build Dollarlog because I felt like the solutions that currently exist for expense tracking are needlessly complex and don't really solve the problem. They tell people how the spend, but don't necessarily give suggestions on how to save - this is what Dollarlog aims to do.

So far, it's been great diving even deeper into iOS. The app is still in development, but I'm hoping that I'll be able to release it in the next few months.

# Muro

Muro is the name of a company that I started with two friends from University. We where fortunate enough to be accepted into an incubator in Sydney where we recieved a small amount of seed funding and working space for 6 months. Over this time, we had to validate our idea, figure out how to monetise (which was extremely difficult), meet with users and investors and build the product.

Muro was platform for people at events to interact and meet new people. We also worked with event organisers to provide them with in depth statistics about demographics for their events. I worked as a designer and web developer, working closely with our iOS developer. I used Photoshop and Illustrator for all our design work, and the site was the usual HTML/CSS/Javascript MAMP stack.

Muro is still on the app store today and we have over a thousand registered users. Unfortunately, we don't actively develop it anymore. Nevertheless, it was an amazing experience and I learnt so much about building things people love to use and how important it is to involve end users in the development process.

# Work (Data Analysis and TCDC)

For the past year and a half, I've been working for one of the big four professional services firms doing a variety of things from Data Analysis to Front End Development.

I started doing Data Analysis over financial data, giving clients insight into how and where there money is going with a focus on identifying fraud. We worked in an Oracle environment and used a variety of OLAP techniques for analysis.

More recently, I've started a new role working on a project for the state government developing a web application for deployment on a tablet to help them more efficiently manage their public transport services. I've been working on the Front End using HTML, SASS and the Angular JS framework.

# JobGPS

JobGPS is a company that is aiming to take on some of the bigger job search engines by providing tailored reccomendations based on a users past employment and their education. I was hired by JobGPS to build their product. This involved building the backend (in mySQL, PHP and a bit of Python) and the front end (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript).

This was a great challenge, because it was the first time I had built an entire service from the ground up by myself. In the end, they where extremely happy with the product and are still using it today.

# Pixol

Pixol is the name of the company that I started in my later years of High School with one of my best friends. We were a web design company with six regular clients. We spent all our spare time after school going to meet with them and building their websites. As a high school student, this was great - it sure beat working at McDonalds!

This taught me all the basic technical skills I used today in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. It also taught me soft skills like how to deal with clients (both happy and unhappy), how to work in a small team and managing finances.
